This research "Enhancing Fake News Detection through Fact-Augmented LLM Generation with Co-Attention" employs two publicly available datasets: GossipCop and Weibo21. As per the journal requirements, we declare the availability of these datasets as follows:

1.GossipCop Dataset
The GossipCop dataset is sourced from the FakeNewsNet public repository (https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet). Due to Twitter privacy policies and news publisher copyright restrictions, the complete data cannot be directly distributed, but can be obtained through the following methods:

The GitHub repository provides gossipcop_fake.csv and gossipcop_real.csv files containing basic information about fake and real news, including unique identifiers, news URLs, titles, and related tweet IDs.

Researchers can use the data collection scripts provided in the repository, along with Twitter API keys, to obtain the complete dataset, including news article content, related tweets and retweet information, user profiles, and social network data.

The data collection process requires a Python 3.6+ environment and follows the configuration and installation instructions provided in the repository.

2.Weibo21 Dataset
The Weibo21 dataset is accessible through the GitHub repository (https://github.com/kennqiang/MDFEND-Weibo21/tree/main/data). This dataset is specifically designed for fake news detection research on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, containing content collected from 2021.Parts of the dataset can be downloaded directly from the above GitHub repository without additional configuration or API keys.
